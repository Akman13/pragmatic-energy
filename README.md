# Pragmatic Energy
Pragmatic Energy is a Full Stack Single Page Application (SPA) which allows for the geographic access to information of over 5000 petrol stations around Australia.
The data pertaining to the petrol stations can be accessed [here](https://researchdata.edu.au/petrol-stations/1208509).

This app utilizes the Google Maps API to visually represent the locations of the petrol stations around Australia as markers, whilst allowing for user interaction with the markers to access further information.
Pragmatic Energy also utilizes an in-built REST JSON API to allow for communication between the client side and the server, providing the user a seamless experience with the client as the server-side data is rendered live on the browser.

## Access
